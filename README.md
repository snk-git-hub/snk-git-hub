I'm a hobbyist developer who’s still figuring things out, learning by building small projects, breaking stuff, and improving step by step. I enjoy exploring different languages, tools, and Linux setups while growing my skills at my own pace.

Programming Languages:  
C++, Rust, JavaScript, Python  

Databases:  
PostgreSQL, MongoDB  

DevOps / Cloud:  
Docker, Kubernetes  

Fedora Linux : )  
I build, test and develop everything on Fedora.
